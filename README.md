UCSD Programming Pre-work Portfolio

## Description

- My curiosity to code and learn more about what makes technology is what is today drove me to take the bootcamp course which led me to build this website
- I built this website because it was fun, interesting, challenging, and a good resource to refer back to
- This website provides an interactive, educational experience for those beginning to code
- I learned a scope of new functions, and languages. This was my first experience building a complete web project.

The Pre-Work Study Guide is a great asset for individuals looking to have an interactive learning experience while they gain skills in the coding world. 

Not only does it list data about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, users can also analyze the code in dev mode, and interact with the manipulatable environment (such as the title image, feel free to click on it). This project also contains visual imagery, and a console display.
